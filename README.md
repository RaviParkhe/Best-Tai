            Dear Tai,</p>

I just wanted to take a moment to let you know how much you mean to me. You are truly the best sister I could ever ask for. Your kindness, support, and the way you always have my back make me feel so incredibly lucky to have you in my life.</p>
<p>Whether we're laughing together, sharing memories, or even going through tough times, you always manage to make everything better. You have such a beautiful heart, and I admire your strength and generosity more than words can express.</p>
<p>Thank you for being the amazing person that you are. I love you more than you know, and Iâ€™m so grateful to be your sibling.</p>
<p>
With all my love,
[Your Name]
        </p>
